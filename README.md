# LuteBot2.1
Lutebot 2.0 improved with auto-download functionality for MIDIs

New features are in Window -> Open -> Guild Library
Currently, you will need to have the Guild Library downloaded and extracted to %appdata%/LuteBot/GuildLibrary/songs
These folders will be created for you when you run LuteBot
The Guild Library can be downloaded from the Bards Guild Discord: https://discord.gg/MmWbkJK

If you do not have the library, it will still attempt to auto-download the songs from the internet, but many songs will fail to be found (and another, similar song will be downloaded), and will often give bad versions as well
