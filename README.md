# LuteBot2.1
Lutebot 2.0 improved with auto-download functionality for MIDIs

New features are in Window -> Open -> Guild Library
Currently, you will need to have the Guild Library downloaded and extracted to %appdata%/LuteBot/GuildLibrary/songs
These folders will be created for you when you run LuteBot
The Guild Library can be downloaded from the Bards Guild Discord: https://discord.gg/MmWbkJK

If you do not have the library, it will still attempt to auto-download the songs from the internet, but many songs will fail to be found (and another, similar song will be downloaded), and will often give bad versions as well


Originally forked from https://github.com/MontyLeGueux/Lutebot-2
But I'm bad at git and had to copy it all over to a separate repository that doesn't show the forking because something weird was going on in Visual Studio's git plugin
