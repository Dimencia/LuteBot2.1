Version 3.5.5

- Track Filtering now opens when a midi is loaded to indicate that adjustments are necessary for most songs to work
- Improved visibility of instrument selection in Track Filtering (it's in the middle now)
- Improved default Track Filtering scale to actually respect time and tempo, showing 15-30s of notes at default size
- First pass of Track Filtering feature overhaul:
	- Added colors to the channel list that matches their note colors
	- Added 'ghost' notes, with a blue outline, from channels/tracks that are disabled on this instrument


- Improved neural network speed via SIMD (fancy superfast thing)
- Possibly improved neural network accuracy via better normalization
- Fixed issue with neural network training UI causing it to report incorrect success rates
- Added ability to pause and continue training
- Training is still WIP and might not work; the AI is worse than I thought and needs some refactoring as a whole

Note that this is all still in-progress and not really finished yet but, still better than before
