Version 3.5.4

- Fixed a MAJOR issue that would cause PartitionIndex files to become malformed
- Fixed startup crash for malformed PartitionIndex files

- Track Filtering now opens when a midi is loaded to indicate that adjustments are necessary for most songs to work
- Improved visibility of instrument selection in Track Filtering (it's at the top now)
- Improved default Track Filtering scale to actually respect time and tempo, showing 15-30s of notes at default size
- First pass of Track Filtering feature overhaul:
	- Added colors to the channel list that matches their note colors
	- Added 'ghost' notes, with a blue outline, from channels/tracks that are disabled on this instrument
	- Honestly, didn't want to include this, but forgot to commit the important fixes by themselves, and too lazy to split them out

- Improved neural network speed via SIMD (fancy superfast thing)
- Possibly improved neural network accuracy via better normalization
- Fixed issue with neural network training UI causing it to report incorrect success rates
- Added ability to pause and continue training
- Training is still WIP and might not work; the AI is worse than I thought and needs some refactoring as a whole
