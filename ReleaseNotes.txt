Version 3.5.0

- MAJOR LuteMod Update:
	- You now play all instruments you have in your equipment; no horse required for duets+
	- Notes that previously would have been delayed or skipped are instead played on extra instruments
	- Pitch settings are now specific to the instrument you have in your hands, they work on your own songs, and are persistent
		- So you can set one of your flutes to +1 pitch and you don't have to keep it equipped for it to work
		- Pressing ctrl+up/down will change your global pitch instead of per-instrument
	- New modes:
		- Pressing shift+up will toggle Note Duplication for the equipped instrument  
			- This means it will make a copy of its notes for other instruments of the same type to play
		- Pressing shift+down will toggle Copying for the equipped instrument type
			- Copies notes from the other instrument type, such as playing flute notes on a lute (enable copying on lute)
		- These apply to all songs you play or mirror until you disable them or join a new game
		- Turning on duplication for all instruments you have of the same type (lute or flute) will make bad things happen
	- Mirroring someone now mirrors every instrument they have, instead of the one they have equipped
	- Ctrl+left/right when navigating partitions now skips 5 pages at a time and doesn't close if it reaches the end or beginning
	- Partition display when you kick is now very fast
		- Caveat: Songs that are split between two partition indexes now make a broken entry in your list (and one good entry).  Worth it.
	- Notes always get transposed into the instrument range when out of range
	- Overhaul to timing to allow faster and more accurate playback
	- Swapping to another instrument while playing no longer pauses playback
	- Removed fastforward/rewind due to issues it was causing
	- Mirror targets are removed from your list when they no longer are holding any instruments
	- Mirror targets no longer show up in chat

- Made lutemod installer remove old lines from Game.ini that were preventing it from working
- Allowed chords for flute
