Version 3.6.0

- Warning: This is currently a 'Beta' (LuteBot can't handle a different versioning style though), it includes major changes that may have accidentally broken obscure things.  It also is missing a few extra things I wanted to add.  Use with caution and wait for the next update for probably lots of bugfixes

- Warning: Old partitions will no longer play correctly on flute.  Select all your songs and use the new 'Resave' button to reload them all with the new settings

- Revamped UI slightly
- Added default path for Epic Mordhau install
- Added note duration and track ordering to LuteMod midis
	- Use Track Selection and click+drag tracks up or down; tracks at the top have priority
	- Higher priority tracks can interrupt lower priority tracks
	- Lower priority tracks can't play until the higher priority notes are done playing
	- Lutes ignore these restrictions but still play the highest priority tracks first
	- Track priority is ordered by the flute-estimation AI by default
- LuteMod updated to handle this new system
	- LuteMod now also forces server update to help ensure all your notes are heard, and has improved timing
- Removed unused/broken functionality; LuteBot no longer supports Rust, Scrap Mechanic, Time Sync, Playlists, Soundboards, or Midi playback
	- Use older versions if necessary (use a real Midi player for Midi playback)
- Removed LuteBot's ability to play in Mordhau (and its related hotkeys and settings) to prevent confusion.  LuteMod should be used instead, check the Help button for more information
- Swapped MIDI parsing engine to use DryWetMidi (should be more consistent and with less lockups and failures)
