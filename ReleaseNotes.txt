Version 3.6.4

- You should probably re-save your midis again, with Reorder.  Use Clear Offsets if you have lots of old midis that are pitched too high or too low

- Rewrote pretty much everything with modern .Net 7 and thread safety; should fix many crashes, improve speed and rendering, and lets me use nice new features
- Fixed crash when re-opening the Guild Library
- Hopefully fixed lockups by making the entire app async
	- So even while it's loading midis, you can select and view them, or drag more in, it's much harder to break
- Fixed issue where auto-ordering, auto-selection, and sometimes lute settings as a whole were failing to save with the partition
- Multi-threaded loading and saving partitions
- Fixed some LuteBot transposition issues (it should no longer transpose at all, LuteMod does that)
- Fixed some LuteMod transposition issues
- Fixed/re-added making all LuteMod midis start at the first played note, with no empty space in front
- Ordering can now be done on Channels
- Flute auto-selection can now occur on Channels or Tracks, depending on which has the best percentages and most options
- Added new setting on Instruments (you need to set it in `%appdata%/LuteBot/Config/Instruments.json` manually for now) to determine what percentages from the AI they should enable (when importing songs without settings, or forcing it to discard settings)
	- Default: Lute 0% to 60%, Flute 50% to 100%
- Added option to ignore old offsets when resaving
- Removed Rust instruments
- Normalized Flute Percentage results displays
- Added right click menu to move the selected Partition(s) to the top of the list
- When saving for LuteMod, chooses either channels or tracks for ordering, depending on which one has the most valid channels/tracks unchecked
	So if you're checking and unchecking things in Tracks, the order of Tracks is what matters, and vice versa
		

LuteMod 2.6.9
	- Fixed issue with transposing low and high notes
	- Fixed issues with note duplication and copying
	- Fixed issue with note copying not respecting track order and prioritizing backwards
	- Fixed accidentally deleting duplicate notes
	- Fixed issue with not properly detecting the owner of a chat message
	- Startup message now instructs you to start a local match to configure LuteMod (or to enter ~Help if already in a local match)
	- Broke Voice - woops.  It was nerfed in the recent patch anyway, this will do for now
			
Note: If something is wrong with the LuteBot changes, you can copy LuteMod 2.69 into your CustomPaks folder to keep its updates
If you don't like the neural network, you can always replace the `channelNeural` file near your LuteBot.exe to an older version, or train your own
