Version 3.6.1

- Fixed startup crash for new users
- Updated Resave to overwrite without asking
- Fixed issue that Resave would remove spaces
- Fixed potential issue causing midis to not be saved to folder when creating a partition
- Fixed incorrect numbers and percentages being displayed in Neural Network training
- Added Neural Network pause/resume during training; it saves when paused
- Improved training model to include more data (if you have your own trained model, it won't work and you'll need to re-train)
- Added menu option to Resave all and to resave all with forced reordering (I suggest using this if you already resaved, to resave again with the improved Neural Network)
- Added crash reporting back
- LuteMod 2.61
	- Re-enabled loading of voice config settings
	- Fixed issue where playing sometimes pauses itself immediately

Version 3.6.0
